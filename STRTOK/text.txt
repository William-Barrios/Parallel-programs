Threaded programming is challenging.
It requires synchronization mechanisms.
Semaphores and mutexes are commonly used.
Avoid data races by careful design.
Multi-threading can increase performance.
However, it adds complexity to the code.
Deadlocks and race conditions are common issues.
Proper locking strategies are essential.
